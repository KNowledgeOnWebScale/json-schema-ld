# Introduction

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a declarative vocabulary for validating JSON format documents. It allows us 
to specify the number of special primitives in a schema or multiple schemas against what valid JSON objects should look 
like. In contrast to JSON-LD, JSON Schema is not designed for linked data. The annotations and structure
described in a JSON Schema are good for an overall API description and for data publishing but unsuitable for data 
share and integration on the web. Thus, we implement this tool [json-to-rdf-shacl] to transform JSON Schema into 
[RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/json-schema) and data shapes in SHACL.
