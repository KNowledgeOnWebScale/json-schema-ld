# Introduction

JSON Schema LD is a syntactic sugar for [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to enable generative interoperability
by means of representing JSON schema in RDF vocabularies ([RDF Scheme](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)) and RDF
shapes in [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/).

A JSON Schema is a declarative vocabulary specifies a number of rules to describe what objects serialized in JSON based
format should look like. With JSON Schema LD, domain models and application profiles are extracted from existing
implementation model in JSON Schema and represented in [RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) and [Shacl shapes](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/).
